## 🧠 Project Overview

This is a reimagined version of Elizabeth Filips’ personal website, developed during a 10-day hackathon as part of the Sheryian Coding School cohort. The goal was to elevate user experience and visual appeal by creating a custom React + Tailwind frontend, while preserving the essence and content of the original site.

## ✅ Completed Features (Pages 1 & 2)

### 1. Landing Page

- Modernized **hero section** with animated text, stylized buttons, and a polished CTA.
- Responsive **navigation header** and **footer** with dynamic newsletter signup and social links.
- Sections for **popular book notes**, YouTube videos, and podcasts—designed with seamless responsiveness in mind.

### 2. Book Notes Page

- Structured **JSON-based content** scraped and transformed from the original site.
- Fully **desktop and mobile responsive** layout with smooth Swiper.js carousel integration.
- **Category-based filtering** powered by dynamic routes (e.g., `/booknotes/medicines`).
- Performance enhancements such as **lazy loading** for book cards.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Components & State:** Context API, reusable components (e.g., Navbar, Carousel)
- **Assets:** Local JSON files for content — simulating a CMS
- **Animations & Effects:** Swiper.js for interactive sliders, CSS animations
